Transit

Overview

This project explores the cybersecurity infrastructure, vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, and regulatory frameworks surrounding two major U.S. public transit fare systems:

MTA OMNY (New York City)
NJ Transit Mobile Ticketing (New Jersey)
Research Focus

Cybersecurity Infrastructure:
Analysis of security measures, technical standards, and compliance with state/federal frameworks.
Vulnerabilities:
Investigation into known and potential security flaws in fare systems, including unauthorized access and privacy risks.
Privacy Concerns:
Examination of how user data is protected, risks of trip-history exposure, and potential misuse of personal information.
Regulatory Frameworks:
Review of relevant laws and best practices, such as New York’s cybersecurity strategy and the New Jersey Data Protection Act (NJDPA).
Key Findings

OMNY’s trip-history feature was disabled due to privacy vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access via credit card data.
Both MTA and NJ Transit operate under strict state cybersecurity and privacy regulations, with requirements for regular security assessments and updates.
NJ Transit complies with the NJDPA, effective 2025, emphasizing consumer data protection and privacy.
